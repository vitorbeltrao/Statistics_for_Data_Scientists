# Statistics by Vítor Beltrão

Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I share a link to a Notion with interesting statistical content. This Notion contains information about exploratory data analysis, probabilities, inferential statistics, correlation, and regression.

Statistics is a science that studies the processes of data collection, organization, analysis, and interpretation. It is a powerful tool for making decisions based on facts and evidence. The content in the Notion that I share in this repository can help you better understand statistics and its fundamental concepts.

The content of this Notion includes:

* An introduction to exploratory data analysis, which is a technique used to summarize and visualize data
* An overview of probabilities, which is a numerical measure that represents the chance of an event occurring
* An introduction to inferential statistics, which is a technique for extrapolating information from a sample to a larger population
* An explanation of correlation and regression, which are techniques used to evaluate the relationship between two variables
* We also have some very useful technical articles that I have separated at the bottom of the page

If you are interested in learning more about statistics, feel free to access the Notion that I share in this repository. There, you will find detailed information on the topics mentioned above, as well as practical examples and exercises to help solidify your knowledge.
